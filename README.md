# Active Record Associations in Conclusion

We now should understand that Active Record automates the ORM setup
significantly in a simpler format.

In this module, we've discussed the advantages of using Active Record and using
association macros. With this understanding of Active Record, persisting data
becomes easier. We can now set up and work with models and build associations
between them by leveraging methods such as `belongs_to`, `has_many`, and
`has_many :through`. We're well on our way to being able to build fully
functioning apps end-to-end.
